      <h1>Review (From "toptenreview) :</h1>
        <p>It's a good choice for casual and novice users, but video editing veterans may want more control over their projects than this software can give.

            <span>Wondershare Filmora</span> is simply elegant video editing software geared toward beginner, novice and casual users. Anyone can learn to use this software, regardless of their skill level, and the end results look and sound fantastic. It has everything you need to make high-quality videos, but leaves out some of the advanced features we look for in this category.
<br><br>
When you launch the program, Filmora gives you two main options: Easy Mode and Full Feature Mode. The former is a great way to get a finished video in just a few minutes. All you have to do is import the clips you want in your video and select a preprogrammed theme and music for your project. Filmora then analyzes your clips and creates a video automatically. Granted, you don’t have a lot of control in this mode, but it’s great for projects that you can make in mere minutes.
<br><br>
Full Feature Mode gives you complete control over your video project. You can edit your project on a timeline or storyboard. You have a total of eight editing tracks to work with on your timeline – and only a single video track. This is adequate for basic projects, and it makes video creation manageable for the average user. However, if you’re looking to make a more complicated project, you may run into some roadblocks since more complex videos require more editing tracks. Other video editing programs we reviewed offer dozens, hundreds and even unlimited editing tracks.
<br><br>
One advanced feature that Filmora offers is its action cam module. This tool focuses on high-resolution footage captured by cameras such as the GoPro. This is great because it gives you the ability to import, edit and export the beautiful, fast-moving and high-definition footage these cameras produce. Only one other program on our lineup has action cam tools such as this.
<br><br>
Anyone should be able to learn to use Wondershare Filmora. Its interface and workflow are among the easiest to grasp of all the video editing programs we reviewed. All the tools and features, like adding text and transitions, applying filters, and exporting, are available from the main window of the interface. You can learn to navigate Filmora in just a few minutes – whereas other programs can take hours.
<br><br>
When you’re done creating your project in Filmora, you have a number of options to get it out into the world. When you export, you can create a simple video file and optimize it for playback on specific devices like smartphones, tablets and gaming systems. You also have the option to upload your project directly to video sharing sites like YouTube, Facebook and Vimeo, which is a great time saver for regularly posting your videos to social media. It also provides the option to burn your project to a DVD.
<br><br>
Because this software is geared toward the casual user, it lacks several of the tools we look for in the best video editing software. For example, you cannot create closed captions for the hearing impaired, import and edit 360-degree video, track moving objects or configure your audio for surround sound. While you can create DVDs with this software, you cannot add a menu to your disc. Our top pick, CyberLink PowerDirector has all these abilities.
            <br><br>
<span>Summary:</span>
If you’re just starting out with video editing, or just want a simple program that works, Wondershare Filmora might be what you’re looking for. It has the essential tools, and anyone can learn to use it easily. However, if you want more advanced tools for more complex projects, you should look at the video editing programs that are designed for more experienced editors.</p>
